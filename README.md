Learning about the planets, stars and other objects drifting through space can feel boring. In order to exhibit the wonder and excitement that space really offers, our group: Aleksandr Belousov, Alp Doymaz, Wai Hlaing, Ngawang Lama, decided to build Space.Obj. It will have 3D models of planets and other foreign bodies in space, with interesting facts and information: size, orbit distance, mass, diameter, gravity, average temperature and much more, of the planets. The users will be able to navigate through the space. It will have a solar calendar and a feature to change the date to visualize the orbital configuration (alignment) of each planet based on the given date. Moverover, to make it more entertaining, itâ€™ll have a page that will allow the users to create planets, based on their own desired characteristics, which can be saved and shared. These features will make Space.Obj an exciting space to learn, explore and enjoy.

Space.Obj offers a platform that can be continually added onto with regards to functionalities, features, etc. Additionally, 3D visualization tools are becoming an ever present way to educate/learn as they offer compelling visuals and make abstract concepts easier to visualize which is what our project brings as noted above. In order to achieve this, we have decided on using React and Three.js for frontend and Django and SQLite/Postgresql for the backend. Three.js, which has a 3D graphics library and can display the 3D render in real time, can be interacted with React, which can display the website, provide interactive UI elements/logic for the user to interact with. React can call Django/Postgresql, which stores the data, APIs to get planet data and update the UI. Wai Hlaing is going to be working on the frontend, using Three.js while helping out with database queries for SQL/Django too. Ngawang will be working on the backend, possibly using Django. Alp will work on the backend in PostGresQL along with the backend calls in Django. Aleksandr will be working on the frontend, using Figma for prototyping and HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Three.js library for 3D models) for the website.
