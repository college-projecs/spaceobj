### color scheme
The background colors used are `#131515` and `#7DE2D1` for various elements.

### project overview
Exploring the planets, stars, and other celestial objects can often seem monotonous. To showcase the true wonder and excitement of space, our team—Aleksandr Belousov, Alp Doymaz, Wai Hlaing, and Ngawang Lama—has developed **Space.Obj**. This project features 3D models of planets and other celestial bodies, complete with fascinating facts and information such as size, orbit distance, mass, diameter, gravity, average temperature, and more. Users will be able to navigate through space, view a solar calendar, and change the date to visualize the orbital configuration of each planet. Additionally, users can create custom planets with desired characteristics, which can be saved and shared, making Space.Obj an engaging and educational experience.

### platform design
**Space.Obj** is designed to be an extensible platform, allowing for continuous addition of new functionalities and features. The use of 3D visualization tools provides compelling visuals and makes abstract concepts easier to understand, enhancing the educational value of the project. 

To achieve this, we have chosen:
- **Frontend:** React and Three.js
- **Backend:** Django with SQLite/PostgreSQL

Three.js, a 3D graphics library, will render the 3D models in real-time, while React will handle the website's interactive UI elements. React will communicate with Django/PostgreSQL to retrieve and update planet data.

### team responsibilities
- **Wai Hlaing:** Frontend development using Three.js and assisting with SQL/Django database queries.
- **Ngawang Lama:** Backend development using Django.
- **Alp Doymaz:** Backend development with PostgreSQL and Django API calls.
- **Aleksandr Belousov:** Frontend development using Figma for prototyping, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Three.js library) for the website.
